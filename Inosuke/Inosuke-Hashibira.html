                        <h1> Inosuke Hashibira </h1>
                        <p>Inosuke Hashibira is a fierce and hot-headed member of the Demon Slayer Corps, raised in the wild by boars. His aggressive and competitive nature often leads him to challenge others, but beneath his rough exterior lies a strong sense of loyalty and a desire to protect his friends. Inosuke wields **Beast Breathing**, a unique swordsmanship style he developed himself, using dual serrated swords and an unpredictable, animalistic fighting style. Despite his brash personality, he gradually learns to trust and value his comrades, proving that strength is not just about power but also about connection and growth.</p>
